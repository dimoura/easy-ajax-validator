# Easy Ajax Form Validator
Hello audience!
This is a really easy ajax form validator that uses javascript to, well.. validate!

We are using a class .required on the inputs so we can check and do the magic. Is really easy to config and implement.

This is a guideline, and if you have any question, pleasea ask me =D
